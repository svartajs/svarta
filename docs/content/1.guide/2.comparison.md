## Why not use...

### Express/Koa, Rant about frameworks

Express and Koa are both described as "unopinionated" web frameworks.
However, they only really provide a routing layer and a bunch of utility (like body parsers, middlewares, ...).
A framework works through inversion of control. It determines the program flow and structure and calls your (the framework user) through well defined interfaces.
Express and Koa are not frameworks, but libraries, which is evident in how much setup is required for both. You need to:

- think of a folder structure
- create and manage all routing by hand
- setup middlewares like body parsers and loggers
- define error handlers
- manually document routes because they are black boxes
- think of how to build and deploy your server
- setup development tools like nodemon for auto restart or ts-node (or similar) for TypeScript support

This is a lot and gets it in the way of actually developing your API.

Svarta takes a more typical framework approach by providing a consistent project structure, build toolchains, automatic routing and more, but not being too opinionated about your tech stack.
You can still decide your

1. database
2. hosting platform
3. authorization strategy
4. testing framework
5. frontend (if needed)
6. etc.

### tRPC

You can integrate tRPC into Svarta! They are not mutually exlusive.
// TODO: tRPC template URL

### GraphQL

Like tRPC, you can add GraphQL support to Svarta.
// TODO: GQL template URL

### Next.js, Remix

If you use React.

### Nuxt

If you use Vue.

### Solid Start

If you use Solid.

### SvelteKit

If you use Svelte.
