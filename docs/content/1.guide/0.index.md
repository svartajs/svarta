# Introduction

Svarta is a modern REST API backend framework tailored towards TypeScript usage.

By abstracting the underlying platform, it allows deployment to different platforms without changing your code. Routes are organized using file-based routing, commonly used in fullstack frameworks like Next.js, Nuxt, SvelteKit or Solid Start.

Currently, supported deployment targets include:

Standalone (default): Uses [tinyhttp](https://github.com/tinyhttp/tinyhttp) to provide a tiny, ESM-based HTTP server
AWS Lambda: Uses API Gateway & AWS Lambda to provide a serverless API

It aims to provide a more robust developer experience than established packages like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Koa](https://koajs.com/).
Svarta can scaffold your application from the ground up, removing the overhead of installing and setting up development dependencies, toolchains and build scripts. *Say goodbye to setting up 15 packages to get your Express project started!*
