# Introduction

Svarta is a TypeScript-native, ESM-native REST API framework.

By abstracting the underlying platform, it allows deployment to different platforms without changing your code. Routes are organized using file-based routing, commonly used in fullstack frameworks like Next.js or SvelteKit.

You also get:

- typesafe middlewares
- file-based routing
- input validation (with [Zod](https://zod.dev/))
- dependency bundling (treeshaking etc.)
- CLI to scaffold projects
- development server with HMR
  <!-- TODO: - serverless support without hacks -->
  <!-- TODO: rest doc generation -->

It aims to provide a more robust developer experience than established packages like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Koa](https://koajs.com/).
Svarta will scaffold your application from the ground up, removing the overhead of installing and setting up development dependencies, toolchains and build scripts. _Say goodbye to setting up 15 packages to get your Express project started!_
