# Introduction

Svarta is a Typescript-native, ESM-native REST API framework.

By abstracting the underlying platform, it allows deployment to different platforms without changing your code. Routes are organized using file-based routing, commonly used in fullstack frameworks like Next.js or SvelteKit.

It aims to provide a more robust developer experience than established packages like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Koa](https://koajs.com/).
Svarta can scaffold your application from the ground up, removing the overhead of installing and setting up development dependencies, toolchains and build scripts. *Say goodbye to setting up 15 packages to get your Express project started!*
