# Introduction

Svarta is a modern REST API backend framework tailored towards TypeScript usage.

It aims to provide a more robust developer experience than established packages like [Express](https://expressjs.com/) or [Koa](https://koajs.com/) by providing file-based routing, type-safe middlewares and more.
Svarta can scaffold your application from the ground up, removing the overhead of installing and setting up development dependencies, toolchains and build scripts. *Say goodbye to setting up 15 packages to get your Express project started!*

It is also platform-agnostic, so you can write your routes without worrying about which platform to deploy your server on. See [Adapters](/deployment) for more info.

## Inspirations

Svarta is mostly inspired by [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) and [tRPC](https://trpc.io/).
