## Rundown of packages

The repository is a monorepo using [pnpm workspaces](https://pnpm.io/workspaces) and [turborepo](https://turbo.build/repo). The packages are as follows:

### `core`

This package contains most type definitions and functionality that will be used in the other packages.

### `svarta`

This is the main user facing package and exports the most important utility, like `Response`, `route` etc from `core`.

### `cli`

This is the [command line tool](/usage/cli), which provides commands like `dev`, `build` etc.

### `dev-server`

This is the [nitro-powered](https://nitro.unjs.io/) development server that will be invoked using `svarta dev`.

### `create-svarta-app`

This is the scaffolding tool, see [Quickstart](/guide/quickstart).

### `adapter-standalone`

This is the standalone adapter, powered by [tinyhttp](https://tinyhttp.v1rtl.site/). See [Adapters](/deployment) for more info.
